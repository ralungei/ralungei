- 👋 Hi, I’m Ras
- 🙇🏻 As a child one day I found it could be a good idea to listen to music with my headphones
- 💡 but instead of plugging them into some music device or the computer
- 🔌 I thought it could work well to plug them in the wall socket.
- ⚡️ That day I got electrocuted...
- 💻 Now, 15 years later I am a Software Engineer!
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack software engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently creating elegant solutions at the IBM Garage Team
